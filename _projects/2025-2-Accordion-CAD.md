As part of a group project my junior fall, I contributed to a CAD model of a small accordion. I personally made the bellows, one endplate, and the keyboard valve block. I was responsible for the full assembly, and also creating animations of the accordion in operation. Here is a render showing an exploded view of the assembly, along with a diagram calling out key components.

And here is it all together.

Here are some close-ups of each component I made

![Exploded Accordion]({{ "/assets/images/Accordion/Valves.png" | relative_url }}){: .center-image}

And finally here is a render showing the accordion in operation.
