## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a young aspiring engineer with a strong foundation in mechanical design and rapid prototyping. I'm deeply passionate about high precision mechatronics and additive manufacturing. I have a growing track record of delivering complex projects from concept through completion. My experience spans hands-on design work, technical analysis, and cross-functional project management. I've developed a unique ability to bridge creative problem-solving with practical execution.

Within this portfolio, you’ll find examples of CAD models, prototype builds, design iterations, and finalized solutions that showcase my approach: user-focused design, data-driven decisions, and clean, manufacturable engineering. Whether it’s designing mechanisms, refining parts and assemblies for manufacturability, or keeping a project on track, I’m driven by curiosity, precision, and the desire to build things that work well.
